# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to apply heuristic evaluation of existing websites or apps and redesign them by combining features of two competing applications to improve the overall user experience.
## Algorithm:
1.Start.
2.Select 2–3 existing apps/websites to analyse (e.g., Nykka Fashion and Spotify).
3.Apply heuristic evaluation to each app (check usability, design, navigation, etc.).
4.Note strengths and weaknesses of each app.
5.Decide which features to combine or improve.
6.Create a prototype or sketch for the new app using the chosen features.
7.Test the new design with users or peers to get feedback.
8.Refine the design based on feedback.
9.End.

Heuristic Evaluation of Existing Apps
A heuristic evaluation checks an app’s usability using basic rules like clarity, consistency, and user control.
Spotify is good in consistency because it uses simple icons and clear labels. It also gives users good control, such as easily liking/unliking songs or moving between screens smoothly.
Nykaa Fashion has a clean and attractive design with big images and neat categories. But it has issues like too many banners on the homepage and filters that sometimes feel confusing or slow.
Comparison and Analysis of User Experience
Spotify gives a better user experience because it is simple, clean, and highly personalized. Users can quickly find songs, playlists, and podcasts without getting confused.
Nykaa Fashion has a beautiful layout, but the filtering and navigation can sometimes be slow or difficult, especially when users search for specific items. This affects the overall shopping experience.
Development and Incorporation of Required Changes

## To improve, Nykaa Fashion needs:

Faster filters
Better product recommendations
AR try-on options
A smoother checkout process
More personalized suggestions

## To improve, Spotify needs:

Better recommendations with less repetition
Separate sections for music, podcasts, and audiobooks
More language support
Stronger social/sharing features
Small, flexible subscription options
Both apps should focus on personalization and easy navigation.

## Evaluation of Design Changes

Changes for Nykaa Fashion should make the app simpler by improving filters, product details, and adding features like “Brand Stories” or “Ratings & Reviews” to help users choose better.
Changes for Spotify should make the layout clearer and more visually appealing, so users can discover music and podcasts more easily.
Overall, both apps benefit from making their designs cleaner, faster, and more personalized for users.

## Result:
The new design successfully combines the transactional power of Nykka Fashion with the engagement style of Spotify, producing a cleaner and more user-friendly app.
